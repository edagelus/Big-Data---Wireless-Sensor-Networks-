# Big-Data---Wireless-Sensor-Networks-
WSNs are highly vulnerable to attacks, due to their open and distributed nature and limited resources of the sensor nodes. Moreover, in WSNs packets broadcasting has to be done frequently, sensor nodes can be deployed randomly in an environment so an attacker adversary can be easily injected to a WSN .

An attacker can compromise a sensor node, eavesdrop messages, inject fake messages, alter the integrity of the data, and waste network resources. Denial of Service (DoS) attack is considered one of the most general and dangerous attacks that threaten WSN security. This attack has several forms and its main objective is to interrupt or suspend the services provided by WSNs
DoS is a common attack that could have a severe impact on WSNâ€™s functionalities and services. Many different types of DoS attacks have been identified so far, for example, Blackhole attack, Grayhole attack, Flooding attack, and Wormhole. 

The classification of  "attack type " has been done using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier with over sampling.
The project was done using Apache Pyspark.
